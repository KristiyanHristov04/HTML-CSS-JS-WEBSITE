    [Guitar Intro]

    [Verse 1]
    So close, no matter how far
    Couldn't be much more from the heart
    Forever trusting who we are
    And nothing else matters
        
    [Verse 2]
    Never opened myself this way
    Life is ours, we live it our way
    All these words I don't just say
    And nothing else matters
        
    [Verse 3]
    Trust I seek and I find in you
    Everyday, for us, something new
    Open mind for a different view
    And nothing else matters
    [Chorus 1]
    Never cared for what they do
    Never cared for what they know
    But I know
        
    [Verse 1]
    So close, no matter how far
    It couldn't be much more from the heart
    Forever trusting who we are
    And nothing else matters
        
    [Chorus 1]
    Never cared for what they do
    Never cared for what they know
    But I know
        
    [Instrumental Bridge]
        
    [Verse 2]
    I never opened myself this way
    Life is ours, we live it our way
    All these words I don't just say
    And nothing else matters
        
    [Verse 3]
    Trust I seek and I find in you
    Everyday, for us, something new
    Open mind for a different view
    And nothing else matters
    [Chorus 2]
    Never cared for what they say
    Never cared for games they play
        
    [Chorus 1]
    Never cared for what they do
    Never cared for what they know
    And I know, yeah-yeah!
        
    [Guitar Solo]
        
    [Verse 1]
    So close, no matter how far
    Couldn't be much more from the heart
    Forever trusting who we are
    No, nothing else matters
