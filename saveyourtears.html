    [Intro]
    Ooh
    Na-na, yeah
    
    [Verse 1]
    I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
    You look so happy when I'm not with you
    But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
    A single teardrop falling from your eye
    
    [Refrain]
    I don't know why I run away
    I make you cry when I run away
    
    [Verse 2]
    You could've asked me why I broke your heart
    You could've told me that you fell apart
    But you walked past me like I wasn't there
    And just pretended like you didn't care
    [Refrain]
    I don't know why I run away
    I make you cry when I run away
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
    Save your tears for another
    
    [Chorus]
    Save your tears for another day
    Save your tears for another day (So)
    
    [Verse 3]
    I made you think that I would always stay
    I said some things that I should never say
   Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
    And now you won't love me for a second time
    
    [Refrain]
    I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
    Said, I make you cry when I run away
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
    Save your tears for another
    I realize that I'm much too late
    And you deserve someone better
    [Chorus]
    Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah)
    Save your tears for another day (Yeah)
    
    [Refrain]
    I don't know why I run away
    I'll make you cry when I run away
    
    [Chorus]
    Save your tears for another day
    Ooh, girl, I said (Ah)
    Save your tears for another day (Ah)
    
    [Outro]
    Save your tears for another day (Ah)
    Save your tears for another day (Ah)</pre>
